2. Gets sent to <Auth />
3. Gets a Create an account to get started
4. path changes to #sign-up
5. Goes to <Authform> to do server magic to add to database

User can sign in.

2. Gets sent to <Auth />
3. User types in account info to get started
4. path changes to #sign-in
5. Goes to <Authform> to sign in and fetches
6. if successful, render gifs

User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page).
1. User stays signed in even when refreshed because the hash location was not changed.


User can sign out.
When user clicks the log out button onclick has "handleSignOut",
this is no longer true, so sent back to sign-in.
if (!this.context.user) return <Redirect to="sign-in" />;
window.localStorage.removeItem('react-context-jwt');
    this.setState({ user: null });
