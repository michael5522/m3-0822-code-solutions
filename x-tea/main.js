      description: 'Centuries ago, Bi Luo Chun (Green Snail Spring) was deemed so remarkable that it was served as a tribute tea to China’s royal families. Though tribute teas may now be a custom of the past, Bi Luo Chun’s majesty continues to prove why the tea held such an honor in the first place. Hailing from Jiangsu province, Bi Luo Chun consists solely of the youngest, most tender leaves and their buds, each plucked from tea trees nestled within the groves of succulent fruit trees. It is these fruit trees that are said to lend a hand in creating the tea’s famous fruity aroma and soothing flavor.'

      region: 'Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China',
      description: 'Long Jing translated from Chinese means “Dragon Well”. Yezi’s Longjing consists entirely of unopened leaf buds called dragon sprouts or water lily hearts.

      description: 'This light tea hails from the town of Logu nestled among the mountains of Nantou County in Taiwan. The tea trees in this part of Taiwan were first transplanted from the famous Wuyi Mountains in 1885. Yezi’s Dong Ding Oolong is brought to you by tea farmer Gao Xiu Chen, who takes great pride in bringing all-natural Dong Ding Oolong to the people of Taiwan and, indeed, the rest of the world. The flavor of Dong Ding Oolong is pure and light with sugarcane sweetness balanced by a hint of bitterness. A perfect confluence of yin and yang, if you will—after one sip of this pure yellow brew, you’ll understand. The loose-leaf tea’s exquisite fragrance evokes visions of the first blossoms of gardenia and often compels the most pragmatic person to lapse into poetry. Its light taste and sublime aura make Dong Ding Oolong ideal for transitioning to a period of mindful activity after an afternoon meal.'

      region: 'Nanhu Mountain, Fujian, China',
      description: 'Gao Shan is grown high in the Nanhu Mountain range on the outskirts of Fuqing City in the Fujian province of China. At these elevations, the near-incessant fog cover and the extreme temperature difference between night and day help make for teas with a complex and diverse flavor palette. Gao Shan is a deep red-brown tea, and its strong, satisfying flavor makes many a tea connoisseur compare it to Kung Fu black tea. A brew of Gao Shan is ideal for firing you up on a dreary day when you could do with a burst of acceleration.'

The citizens of Fuzhou know that there are fewer sensations more rejuvenating than the fragrance of jasmine flowers wafting through their windows on evenings ideal for quiet contemplation. Now you, too, can enjoy this carefully handcrafted loose-leaf green tea. Be sure to note how, as soon as the Mo Li Hua leaves come into contact with water, they expand into exquisite floral patterns, further accentuating the goodness of the brew.'

The tea produces a strong, smoky flavor with contrasting tones of chocolate and caramel. Yezi is able to bring you the finest-quality Jin Pin tea because of our collaboration with farmer Huang Jian. For the last 250 years, the Nanhu Mountain range has been home to some of China’s highest-quality organic teas, and we are confident that you’ll take just one sip and say, “I agree.”'

      description: 'Silver Needle tea has been grown in the Fuding County of Fujian province since the early days of the Ming Dynasty. Our tea comes from local tea farmer Yu Qizhao. The tea is harvested in spring, when the young sprouts possess an intensely fresh flavor. After they are harvested, the tea leaves are set across bamboo trays to dry. This loose-leaf tea has a smooth, delicate, honey-sweet flavor with notes of tangerine. Many Chinese consider Silver Needle to be the personification of sophisticated enjoyment and preserve their reserves of if for special occasions such as the New Year, weddings, and family reunions.'

Among the richest and rarest teas in the world, Da Hong Pao is more than 350 years old and is the highest grade of Wuyi oolong tea.'
